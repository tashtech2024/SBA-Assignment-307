        Unlike most Dutch masters of the 
     17th century, Rembrandt's works depict 
     a wide range of style and subject matter, 
     from portraits and self-portraits to 
     landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical 
     and historical scenes, and biblical and 
     mythological themes as well as animal 
     studies.
     
        His contributions to art came in a 
     period of great wealth and cultural 
     achievement  that historians call the 
     Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art 
     (especially Dutch painting), although 
     in many ways antithetical to the 
     Baroque style that dominated Europe, 
     was extremely prolific and innovative 
     and gave rise to important new genres. 
     Like many artists of the Dutch Golden 
     Age, such as Jan Vermeer of Delft, 
     Rembrandt was also an avid art 
     collector and dealer.
